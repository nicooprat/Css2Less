            ## WTF ?
    
            This tool has been thought for front-end developers who are tired of working with CSS. Here you can quickly convert your old CSS files to fresh new LESS files.    
            As easy as copy/paste. You can also convert files locally by running the Ruby gem (see git repository above).
            
            ## Credits
            
            Css2Less is based on the work of [Sickill](https://github.com/sickill/css2less). It's brought to you by [Thomas Pierson](http://thomaspierson.fr/) & [Nico Prat](https://twitter.com/#!/nicooprat).    
            This service run on Sinatra and has been built with HAML & LESS (guess what) with the help of the excellent [ACE Editor](http://ace.ajax.org/).    
            Css2Less is self-hosted on an ecologic server at home :)
            
            ## Questions ?
            
            __LESS is cool. What about other awesomenesses ?__
            You could also check out [Css2Sass](http://css2sass.heroku.com/), [Js2Coffee](http://js2coffee.org/)
            and [Html2Haml](http://html2haml.heroku.com/). What a wonderful world.
            
            __Get in touch__
            You can report bugs, propose ideas and participate on our Github repository.
            
            __Why .cc ?__
            We finally decided that CC should mean Communist Compiler. Ya, we've a lot of imagination. If you know the real signification, please tell us. Anyway, it looks nice, doesn't it ?
            
            __What about Internet Explorer ?__
            Unfortunately, ACE Editor doesn't really support Internet Explorer. Not our fault ! But I'm sure you're not using it...
